# Mail Merge Magic

Tired of typing the same letter over and over?
This project takes a **template letter** + a **list of names** and automatically creates personalized letters for everyone.

---

## Project Structure

```
Mail Merge Project Start/
├── Input/
│   ├── Letters/
│   │   └── starting_letter.txt      # Your template
│   └── Names/
│       └── invited_names.txt        # List of names
├── Output/
│   └── ReadyToSend/                 # Personalized letters land here
│       └── letter_for_<name>.txt
└── main.py                          # The script that does the magic
```

* **`starting_letter.txt`** → Your template. Use `[name]` wherever the person’s name should go.
* **`invited_names.txt`** → A list of names (one per line).
* **`ReadyToSend/`** → All generated letters will appear here.

---

## How It Works

1. Read the names list
2. Find the `[name]` placeholder in the template
3. Replace it with each real name
4. Save each personalized letter into `ReadyToSend/`

---

## Usage

1. Clone this repo or download the project.
2. Add your names to:

   ```
   Input/Names/invited_names.txt
   ```
3. Customize your letter in:

   ```
   Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt
   ```

    Use `[name]` wherever you want the recipient’s name to appear.
4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
5. Open `Output/ReadyToSend/` and collect your letters.

## Example

**Template (`starting_letter.txt`):**
